# ReactJS For Web Development
This resource is to help you have a deep understanding of **React** in order to improve your proficiency with the framework. You are encouraged to create a new React application using the guidelines in each section and add new concepts to your project as guided by the levels listed below.

## Project Levels
This project is arranged into  **4 Levels** and each level adds new concepts onto what the previous level already contains, this is to help in the step by step understanding of the different concepts implemented in a React application dependant on complexity level.

### Level 01
- Create a new React App
- Editing boilerplate code in `App.js`
- Images and more HTML element tags
- Styling elements in `App.js` using `App.css`

### File Structure
This is the basic file structure of a new project when created using the `npx create-react-app` command.
- `public`: Contains entry point of your application file (`index.html`)
- `src`: Holds all the files that make up your web application, and is the folder you'll interact with the most.
    - App.js
    - App.css
- `package.json`: This is the file that has the holds your application dependencies and instructions on how to run or build your application.
- README.md
- .gitignore

**Note:** There are other folders and files, however, we've only included the folders/files that are most used/important while working on your project.
